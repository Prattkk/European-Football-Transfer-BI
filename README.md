## 🎯 Project Objective
This project applies **Business Intelligence and predictive analytics techniques** to analyze European football transfer data and build a **data-driven classification model** that evaluates transfer outcomes. The goal is to support **better scouting and investment decisions** using historical player and market data.

---

## 🧠 Business Problem
European football clubs invest significant financial resources in player transfers, often with uncertain outcomes. Poor transfer decisions can lead to financial losses and underperformance. This project addresses the challenge of **predicting transfer success** by analyzing historical trends, player attributes, and market indicators.

- **Scope:** Multiple European leagues
- **Key features include:**
  - Player age
  - Playing position
  - Market value
  - League affiliation
  - Historical performance indicators

Data was cleaned, filtered, and preprocessed prior to analysis and modeling.
